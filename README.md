# 8 bit ALU

8 bit ALU is written in Lucid HDL. It can be ran on a Mojo, which is a FPGA. 
The 8 bit ALU is made up 4 main components: Adder, Boolean, Shifter and Comparator
Go ahead and play around with the switches on the Mojo Shield to try the different functions of the ALU
A table of code is included to select which function to use
There is an automated self testing system that you can start by pressing the center button
Enjoy! :)
