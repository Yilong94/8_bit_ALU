# 8 bit ALU

## 8 bit ALU is written in Lucid HDL. It can be ran on a Mojo, which is a FPGA. 
## The 8 bit ALU is made up 4 main components: Adder, Boolean, Shifter and Comparator
## Go ahead and play around with the switches on the Mojo Shield to try the different functions of the ALU
## A table of code is included to select which function to use
## There is an automated self testing system that you can start by pressing the center butto
## Enjoy! :)
